I have this input How do i extract the list? Baking powder is a common leavening agent used in many baked goods, but if you don't have it, there are some substitutions you can try. One option is to make a homemade version of baking powder by mixing 1 teaspoon of baking soda with 1/2 teaspoon of cream of tartar. This combination will provide a similar leavening effect to baking powder. Another option is to use baking soda alone, but you'll need to add an acidic ingredient like buttermilk or yogurt to activate it. The general rule of thumb is to use 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda and 1 cup of buttermilk or yogurt. Keep in mind that these substitutions might affect the texture and flavor of your final product slightly, so some experimentation might be necessary to get the desired result. Here are some recipes that use baking powder or its substitutes: [ { "name": "Buttermilk Biscuits", "description": "Flaky, tender biscuits made with buttermilk and baking soda", }, { "name": "Homemade Baking Powder Pancakes", "description": "Light and fluffy pancakes made with homemade baking powder", }, { "name": "Yogurt and Honey Muffins", "description": "Moist and flavorful muffins made with yogurt and baking soda", } ] Which one of these recipes sounds interesting to you? Or do you have a specific recipe in mind where you need to substitute baking powder?Attachments:

Assistant: 
I can see you need to extract a list from a text that contains information about baking powder substitutions and some recipes. Let me help you parse this text to extract the list of recipes.

Based on the text, there appears to be a JSON array containing recipes. Let me write a Python script that can extract this list from the text input.# Extracting a Recipe List from Text

I've created a Jupyter notebook called `extract_recipes.ipynb` that will help you extract the recipe list from your text.

The notebook contains two cells:

1. The first cell stores your input text as a Python string.
2. The second cell extracts the recipe list using regular expressions and the `json` module.

Here's how the code works:

1. It uses a regular expression to find the JSON array in your text (anything between `[` and `]`).
2. It cleans up the JSON string by removing trailing commas (which can cause JSON parsing errors).
3. It parses the JSON into a Python list of dictionaries.
4. It prints out each recipe with its name and description.

When you run the notebook, you'll get the list of recipes extracted from your text:

```
Extracted Recipes:
- Buttermilk Biscuits: Flaky, tender biscuits made with buttermilk and baking soda
- Homemade Baking Powder Pancakes: Light and fluffy pancakes made with homemade baking powder
- Yogurt and Honey Muffins: Moist and flavorful muffins made with yogurt and baking soda
```

You can open the notebook in PyCharm and run it to see the results, or modify it if you need to extract different information from the text.
Before answering it did these function calls:
