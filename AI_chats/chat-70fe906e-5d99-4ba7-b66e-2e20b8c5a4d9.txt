Assistant: 
I see you're working on implementing content filtering functionality for a meals database, and you need help with filtering parts of the JSON response returned by the `search_by_name` method.

Looking at your code, I notice there's an incomplete `_apply_filters` method that needs to be implemented to handle the filtering of the meal results. Based on the provided JSON example and your current code structure, let's implement this method.

The JSON response has a structure with a "meals" key containing a list of meal objects, and you need to filter specific parts of each meal entry.

Here's how you can implement the `_apply_filters` method:I can see you have a `ContentFilter` class that helps filter API results, and you're working with a JSON response that has meal data with various properties. You want to know how to filter different parts of each meal entry in the response. Let's implement the missing functionality in the `_apply_filters` method.

Based on the JSON structure you provided, I'll complete the `_apply_filters` method to handle both the case where results is a dictionary with a "meals" list and where it's directly a list of meals:

```python
def _apply_filters(self, results):
    # Handle case where results is a dictionary with 'meals' key
    if isinstance(results, dict) and 'meals' in results:
        filtered_meals = []
        for meal in results['meals']:
            if meal and self._passes_filter(meal):
                filtered_meals.append(meal)
        
        # Return with the same structure
        return {'meals': filtered_meals}
    
    # Handle case where results is a list of items
    elif isinstance(results, list):
        filtered_results = []
        for item in results:
            if item and self._passes_filter(item):
                filtered_results.append(item)
        return filtered_results
    
    # Handle single item
    elif results and self._passes_filter(results):
        return results
    
    # If results is None or doesn't pass filter
    return None
```

You'll also need to update the `_passes_filter` method to work with structured meal data. Currently, it's trying to check for profanity directly on the result object, which won't work with dictionaries. Here's a better implementation:

```python
def _passes_filter(self, result) -> bool:
    # If result is a dictionary (like a meal entry)
    if isinstance(result, dict):
        # Check text fields for profanity
        for key, value in result.items():
            # Only check string values that start with 'str' (like strMeal, strInstructions)
            if isinstance(value, str) and key.startswith('str'):
                if profanity.contains_profanity(value):
                    return False
                
        # Apply any custom filter rules defined
        for key, rule in self.filter_rules.items():
            if key in result and not rule(result[key]):
                return False
                
        return True
    
    # If result is a string
    elif isinstance(result, str):
        return not profanity.contains_profanity(result)
    
    # For other types, no filtering
    return True
```

With these implementations:
1. `_apply_filters` will process the entire result set while maintaining its structure
2. `_passes_filter` will check individual meals for profanity in text fields
3. You can also extend the filtering with custom rules defined in `filter_rules`

For example, you could add custom filter rules when creating a ContentFilter instance:

```python
# Example usage
filter_rules = {
    'strCategory': lambda x: x != 'Dessert',  # Filter out desserts
    'strArea': lambda x: x in ['Italian', 'Chinese']  # Only include Italian or Chinese foods
}
filtered_db = ContentFilter(api_db, filter_rules)
```

This approach provides a flexible way to filter different parts of each entry in the response.

Assistant: 
Looking at your updated code, I see you've implemented the `_apply_filters` method to handle different types of responses (meals, drinks, or lists) and you're trying to censor content rather than filter it out completely.

However, there's a problem with the `_censor_result` method. It's currently trying to use `profanity.censor()` directly on the result object, which is a dictionary for meal or drink entries, not a string. Let's fix the `_censor_result` method to properly handle dictionary objects like the meal data you provided.

Here's how we can implement `_censor_result` to work with your JSON structure:

```python
def _censor_result(self, result):
    # Handle None values
    if result is None:
        return None
        
    # If it's a dictionary (like a meal or drink entry)
    if isinstance(result, dict):
        censored_result = result.copy()  # Create a copy to avoid modifying the original
        
        # Censor all string values in the dictionary
        for key, value in censored_result.items():
            if isinstance(value, str) and value.strip():  # Check if it's a non-empty string
                censored_result[key] = profanity.censor(value)
                
        return censored_result
        
    # If it's a string
    elif isinstance(result, str):
        return profanity.censor(result)
        
    # For other types, return as is
    return result
```

Also, let's update the `_passes_filter` method to correctly check dictionaries:

```python
def _passes_filter(self, result) -> bool:
    # Handle None values
    if result is None:
        return False
        
    # If it's a dictionary (like a meal or drink entry)
    if isinstance(result, dict):
        # Check all string values for profanity
        for value in result.values():
            if isinstance(value, str) and value.strip() and profanity.contains_profanity(value):
                return False
        return True
        
    # If it's a string
    elif isinstance(result, str):
        return not profanity.contains_profanity(result)
        
    # For other types
    return True
```

These updated methods will properly handle your JSON structure and:
1. The `_censor_result` method will scan through all string fields in the meal/drink dictionaries and censor any profane words
2. The `_passes_filter` method will check if any string field contains profanity and filter accordingly

This approach should work with your current `_apply_filters` implementation.
