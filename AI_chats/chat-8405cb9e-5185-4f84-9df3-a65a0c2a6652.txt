Assistant: 
I see you want to add a GitHub corner to your Next.js layout component. This is a common UI element that links to a GitHub repository, displaying a cat-like corner icon.

Let's add this GitHub corner to your layout.tsx file. The best place would be inside the body element but before the rest of the content, so it's positioned correctly in the top-right corner of the page.I'll help you add the GitHub corner element to your layout.tsx file. The code you provided is an SVG-based GitHub corner that links to your repository. Here's how to add it to your React Next.js application:

The best place to add this element would be in your Layout component, specifically inside the body tag. This will ensure the GitHub corner appears on all pages of your application.

Here's how to modify your layout.tsx file:

<llm-snippet-file>layout.tsx</llm-snippet-file>
```typescript jsx
"use client";
import './globals.css'

import TopNav from "@/app/components/topNav";
import {getUsername} from "@/app/hooks/Auth";
import React from "react";
import {GoogleTagManager} from "@next/third-parties/google";

            </body>

        </html>
    );
};

export default Layout;
```

### Key changes made:

1. I added the GitHub corner link and SVG just after the opening `<body>` tag
2. Changed `class` to `className` for React JSX compatibility
3. Converted inline CSS styles to React's object style syntax (using double curly braces and camelCase properties)
4. Added the animation styles using styled-jsx syntax (`<style jsx>{``}</style>`)

### Important Notes:

1. Make sure to replace `"https://your-url"` with your actual GitHub repository URL
2. You can customize the color by changing the `fill` property in the SVG style (currently set to `#FD6C6C`)
3. The GitHub corner will appear at the top-right corner of every page in your application

This implementation ensures the GitHub corner displays correctly while following React and Next.js best practices.
Before answering it did these function calls:

Document link: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/2025.1/react.html#ws_react_extract_component
Snippet:
You can create a new React component by extracting the JSX code from the render method of an existing component. The new component can be defined as a function or as a class, refer to Function and Class Components on the React official website.


Document link: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/2025.1/react.html#react_code_completion_html_tags_and_components
Snippet:
PyCharm provides code completion for HTML tags and component names that you have defined inside methods in JavaScript or inside other components:
Completion also works for imported components with ES6 style syntax:


Document link: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/2025.1/react.html#react_transfer_html_attributes_to_jsx
Snippet:
When you copy a piece of HTML code with class attributes or on-event handlers and paste it into JSX, PyCharm automatically replaces these attributes with React-specific ones (className, onClick, onChange, and so on.)
This also works for TSX:
When you copy a piece of HTML code that contains single tags and paste it into JSX, PyCharm automatically adds a slash / at the end of each single tag.
To copy HTML code to JSX or TSX as is, use Paste Simple Ctrl+Alt+Shift+V or  open the Settings dialog (Ctrl+Alt+S) , go to Editor | General | Smart Keys | JavaScript, settings page and clear the Close HTML single tags when pasting code into JSX files and the Convert HTML attribute names when pasting into JSX files checkboxes.
Actions:
<Action id: EditorPasteSimple; Title: Paste as Plain Text; Shortcut: Ctrl+Alt+Shift+V Description: Paste without formatting, auto-import, literal escaping, etc.>
<Action id: ShowSettings; Title: Settings…; Shortcut: Ctrl+Alt+S Description: Edit application settings>


Document link: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/2025.1/react.html#react_code_snippets_procedure
Snippet:
- Type the required abbreviation in the editor and press Tab.
- Press Ctrl+J and choose the relevant snippet. To narrow down the search, start typing the abbreviation and then select it from the completion list.
For more information, refer to Live Templates.
Actions:
<Action id: EditorTab; Title: Tab; Shortcut: Tab Description: <no description>>
<Action id: InsertLiveTemplate; Title: Insert Live Template…; Shortcut: Ctrl+J Description: Show a popup list of live templates starting with the specified prefix>


Document link: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/2025.1/react.html#react_code_snippets
Snippet:
PyCharm comes with a collection of more than 50 code snippets that expand into different statements and blocks of code often used in React apps, including React Hooks. The example below shows how you can use the rcjc abbreviation to create a class that defines a new React component:


Document link: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/2025.1/react.html#react_emmet
Snippet:
With PyCharm, you can use Emmet not only in HTML but also in your JSX code taking advantage of some special React twists. For example, the abbreviation div.my-class expands in JSX to <div className=”my-class"></div> but not to <div class=”my-class"></div> as it would in HTML:


Document link: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/2025.1/react.html#react_running_and_debugging_run
Snippet:
Only for applications created with create-react-app.


Document link: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/2025.1/react.html#react_code_completion_methods_and_attributes
Snippet:
By default, the code completion popup is displayed automatically as you type. For example:
In JSX tags, PyCharm provides coding assistance for React-specific attributes, such as className or classID, and non-DOM attributes, such as key or ref. Moreover, auto-completion also works for names of classes defined in the project’s CSS files:
All React events, such as onClick or onChange, can also be completed automatically together with curly braces  ={} or quotes "".
By default, curly braces are inserted. You can have PyCharm always add quotes or choose between quotes or braces based on the type from a TypeScript definition file (d.ts). To change the default setting,  open the Settings dialog (Ctrl+Alt+S) , go to Editor | Code Style | HTML and select the applicable option from the Add for JSX attributes list.
Completion also works for JavaScript expressions inside curly braces. This applies to all the methods and functions that you have defined:
Actions:
<Action id: ShowSettings; Title: Settings…; Shortcut: Ctrl+Alt+S Description: Edit application settings>


Document link: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/2025.1/react.html#ws_react_rename_component
Snippet:
Below is an example of renaming a component that is defined and used in only one file:
In the same way, you can rename components defined in one file and then imported to another file using a named export:


Document link: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/2025.1/react.html#react_code_completion
Snippet:
PyCharm provides code completion for React APIs and JSX in JavaScript code. Code completion works for React methods, React-specific attributes, HTML tags and component names, React events, component properties, and so on. Learn more from the React official website.
To get code completion for React methods and React-specific attributes, you need to have the              react.js          library file somewhere in your project. Usually the library is already in your node_modules folder.

 
The search result is limited to 10 documents. You MUST decide which answers are useful for user by yourself.
As search engine and documentation may be not perfect, this result is intended to be complementary to final answer rather than final answer itself.

When employing information from a document, you MUST reference it using this syntax: [[number]](document_link).
For instance: [[1]](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/getting-started.html)
Numbers should be incremented in order of referencing them starting from 1. Non-referenced documents shouldn't affect number incrementation, because user doesn't see search result itself.
There are many nuances with the display of shortcuts. In order not to confuse them with punctuation marks, and also to clearly separate each key, you MUST use separate inline code span syntax for each key. Separate this keys by space.
If shortcut contain backtick (`) key, use double-backtick span for it: `` ` ``.
Example for ⌃⇧` shortcut usage: `⌃` `⇧` `` ` ``

If you want to mention an action for user, in your next steps you MUST embed action button in message with following syntax: 
<ActionButton id="ACTION_ID"/> (with ACTION_ID changed to actual id).
For ShowSettings action, you can also specify path to specific page with value attribute:
<ActionButton id="ShowSettings" value="Path | To | Page"/> (it is crucial to use pipe symbol ("|") for separating path pages).
Furthermore, you can include a search query as the last element, which will result in the highlighting of all occurrences of query on the page:
For example: <ActionButton id="ShowSettings" value="Path | To | Page | query"/>
