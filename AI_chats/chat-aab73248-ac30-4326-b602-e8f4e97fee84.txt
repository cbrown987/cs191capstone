Assistant: 
I can see the issue in your code. The component you've defined is an async component directly returning JSX, but it's continuously being called because it's not using Next.js component patterns correctly. Let me explain what's happening and how to fix it.

## The Issue

In Next.js, when you define a page component using `export default async` like you have, it's treated as a Server Component. However, you've also marked it with `'use client'` at the top, which is contradictory - it tells Next.js to run this component on the client, but the `async` behavior is meant for server components.

The main problem is that your component is a function that receives params, makes API calls, and returns JSX - but it's not structured properly for Next.js routing.

## Solution

Let's fix your code:# Issue with Infinite API Calls in Next.js Component

I can see the problem in your code. The issue is with how you're creating an async component in a Next.js client component. This is causing infinite API calls to happen.

## The Problem

There are two main issues with your code:

1. **Async Components in Client Context**: You're using `export default async ({ params })` in what appears to be a client component (indicated by 'use client' at the top), but async components are only supported in server components [[1]](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/42180).

2. **Infinite Loop**: When you use an async component on the client side, it causes the component to remount repeatedly, leading to infinite API calls to `callRecipeApiWithID`.

## Solution

Here's how to fix your code:

1. Keep this file as a server component by removing the 'use client' directive (server components can be async)

OR

2. If you need this to be a client component, modify it to use hooks instead of making the component itself async:

```typescript jsx
'use client'

import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import {callRecipeApiWithID, getApi} from "@/app/lib/api";
import {RecipeComponent} from "@/app/components/RecipeComponent/RecipeComponent";
import {notFound} from "next/navigation";

/**
 * Dynamic page for specific food recipes based on ID
 * @param params The ID passed in the url
 */
export default function RecipePage({ params }: { params: { id: string } }) {
  const [recipe, setRecipe] = useState(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
  const [error, setError] = useState(false);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchRecipe = async () => {
      try {
        const data = await callRecipeApiWithID("M", params.id);
        setRecipe(data);
        setLoading(false);
      } catch (error) {
        console.error(`Failed to fetch food recipe with ID ${params.id}:`, error);
        setError(true);
        setLoading(false);
      }
    };
    
    fetchRecipe();
  }, [params.id]); // Only re-run if ID changes
  
  if (loading) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }
  
  if (error || !recipe) {
    notFound();
  }

  return(
    <>
      <RecipeComponent
        id={recipe['id'] || params.id}
        title={recipe['title'] || 'Unnamed Recipe'}
        description={recipe['description'] || null}
        instructions={recipe['instructions'] || []}
        imageURL={recipe['imageURL'] || '/images/placeholder-food.png'}
        ingredients={recipe['ingredients'] || []}
        type={"food"}
      />
    </>
  );
}
```

## Why This Works

- By using React hooks (`useState` and `useEffect`), we properly handle data fetching in client components.
- The `useEffect` hook with a dependency array `[params.id]` ensures the API is only called when the ID changes.
- We properly handle loading and error states.

## Alternative Approach

If you prefer to keep your original structure, simply remove the 'use client' directive from the top of your file. Next.js supports async components in server components and will properly handle the data fetching workflow.

Would you like me to explain any part of this solution in more detail?

Snippet:
Suppose that for some reason you decide to change the folder structure of the application from the previous example and move index.html and App.js to a separate folder src.
Because the local sources and the application on the web server are structured differently, the debugger will be unable to sync the local sources with the code that is actually executed.
To solve the problem, let's map the URL address of the application root with the src folder.

As search engine and documentation may be not perfect, this result is intended to be complementary to final answer rather than final answer itself.

When employing information from a document, you MUST reference it using this syntax: [[number]](document_link).
For instance: [[1]](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/getting-started.html)
Numbers should be incremented in order of referencing them starting from 1. Non-referenced documents shouldn't affect number incrementation, because user doesn't see search result itself.
There are many nuances with the display of shortcuts. In order not to confuse them with punctuation marks, and also to clearly separate each key, you MUST use separate inline code span syntax for each key. Separate this keys by space.
If shortcut contain backtick (`) key, use double-backtick span for it: `` ` ``.
Example for ⌃⇧` shortcut usage: `⌃` `⇧` `` ` ``

If you want to mention an action for user, in your next steps you MUST embed action button in message with following syntax: 
<ActionButton id="ACTION_ID"/> (with ACTION_ID changed to actual id).

It allows you to defer loading of Client Components and imported libraries, and only include them in the client bundle when they're needed. Lazy loading applies to Client Components. Importing Client Components When using React.lazy() and Suspense, Client Components will be prerendered (SSR) by default. If you want to disable pre-rendering for a Client Component, you can use the ssr option set to false: Importing Server Components If you dynamically import a Server Component, only the Client Components that are children of the Server Component will be lazy-loaded - not the Server Component itself. Note: ssr: false option is not supported in Server Components. ssr: false is not allowed with next/dynamic in Server Components. Please move it into a client component.

The offset query parameter present on the URL helps to precise to the API on which page we want to fetch data. This hook takes 3 arguments: The first argument is the query key which helps to identify the query in the cache; the second argument is the query function which is the function the query will use to fetch the data; and the third argument getNextPageParam which indicates whether the next page is available or not. Hot take: If our API uses pages instead of offsets to fetch data we’ll instead add one to the allPages.length rather than multiplying by the number of elements per page. The data will be returned in series of pages each containing 20 elements as shown in the image below:

How To Handle Async Data Loading, Lazy Loading, and Code Splitting with React | DigitalOcean When you use React functional components for example, asynchronous functions can create infinite loops. In future versions of React, you’ll be able to use Suspense to load data in nested components without render blocking. In this tutorial, you’ll handle asynchronous data in React by creating an app that displays information on rivers and simulates requests to Web APIs with setTimeout. Suppose you called the asynchronous function inside of your component and then set the data to a variable using the useState Hook. You’ll update the component by setting the riverInformation when the asynchronous function resolves.

---

Summarized answer:
To implement infinite loading in Next.js, use the `useState` and `useEffect` hooks for state management and fetching more data on scroll. Use `react-intersection-observer` to detect when to load more data. Next.js server actions can cache data for performance.

Whenever employing ANY information from a Web Search Result, you MUST leave reference using this syntax: [[number]](https://...).

Assistant: 
Yes, this code has the same issue as the previous one. Here's how to fix it:

```typescript jsx
'use client'

import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import {callRecipeApiWithID, getImage} from "@/app/lib/api";
import {RecipeComponent} from "@/app/components/RecipeComponent/RecipeComponent";

/**
 * Dynamic page for specific drink recipes based on ID
 * @param params The ID passed in the url
 */
export default function DrinkRecipePage({ params }: { params: { id: string } }) {
  const [recipe, setRecipe] = useState<any>(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
  const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchRecipe = async () => {
      try {
        const data = await callRecipeApiWithID("C", params.id);
        setRecipe(data);
        setLoading(false);
      } catch (err) {
        console.error(`Failed to fetch drink recipe with ID ${params.id}:`, err);
        setError("Failed to load recipe data");
        setLoading(false);
      }
    };
    
    fetchRecipe();
  }, [params.id]); // Only re-run if ID changes
  
  if (loading) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }
  
  if (error || !recipe) {
    return (
      <div className="max-w-4xl mx-auto py-8 px-4 text-center">
        <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Recipe Not Found</h1>
        <p className="text-lg mb-6">
          {error || `The drink recipe you're looking for (ID: ${params.id}) could not be found.`}
        </p>
        <a href="/menu" className="inline-block px-6 py-3 bg-blue-600 text-white rounded hover:bg-blue-700">
          Return to Menu
        </a>
      </div>
    );
  }

  return(
    <>
      <RecipeComponent
        id={recipe['id'] || params.id}
        title={recipe['title'] || 'Unnamed Recipe'}
        description={recipe['description'] || null}
        instructions={recipe['instructions'] || []}
        imageURL={recipe['imageURL'] || '/images/placeholder-drink.png'}
        ingredients={recipe['ingredients'] || []}
        type={'drinks'}
      />
    </>
  );
}
```

The issue is the same as before:

1. You're using `export default async` in a client component (marked with 'use client'), which causes infinite rendering.

2. The fix converts the component to use React hooks (`useState` and `useEffect`) to properly manage the data fetching lifecycle:
   - We fetch data only when the component mounts or the ID changes
   - We track loading and error states
   - We render appropriate UI for each state

Alternatively, if you prefer to keep your original structure with an async component, you can simply remove the 'use client' directive from the top of your file to make it a server component, which supports async components natively.

User: 
Sometimes this takes a really long time and it resolves correctly in the api backend but it still states it had an error

Assistant: 
If you're experiencing issues where the API call technically succeeds in the backend but your front-end still reports an error, there are several potential causes. Let's modify the solution to address timing problems and improve error handling:

```typescript jsx
'use client'

import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import {callRecipeApiWithID, getImage} from "@/app/lib/api";
import {RecipeComponent} from "@/app/components/RecipeComponent/RecipeComponent";

/**
 * Dynamic page for specific drink recipes based on ID
 * @param params The ID passed in the url
 */
export default function DrinkRecipePage({ params }: { params: { id: string } }) {
  const [recipe, setRecipe] = useState<any>(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
  const [error, setError] = useState<string | null>(null);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    let isMounted = true;
    setLoading(true);
    setError(null);
    
    const fetchRecipe = async () => {
      try {
        // Add timeout to handle potentially long-running API calls
        const timeoutPromise = new Promise((_, reject) => 
          setTimeout(() => reject(new Error('Request timeout')), 30000) // 30 second timeout
        );
        
        // Race between API call and timeout
        const data = await Promise.race([
          callRecipeApiWithID("C", params.id),
          timeoutPromise
        ]);
        
        // Check if component is still mounted before updating state
        if (isMounted) {
          setRecipe(data);
          setLoading(false);
        }
      } catch (err) {
        console.error(`Failed to fetch drink recipe with ID ${params.id}:`, err);
        if (isMounted) {
          const errorMessage = err instanceof Error 
            ? (err.message === 'Request timeout' ? 'Request timed out. Please try again.' : err.message)
            : 'Failed to load recipe data';
          setError(errorMessage);
          setLoading(false);
        }
      }
    };
    
    fetchRecipe();
    
    // Cleanup function to prevent state updates if component unmounts during fetch
    return () => {
      isMounted = false;
    };
  }, [params.id]);
  
  // Show a loading state with feedback
  if (loading) {
    return (
      <div className="max-w-4xl mx-auto py-8 px-4 text-center">
        <div className="animate-pulse">
          <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Loading Recipe...</h1>
          <p className="text-lg mb-6">
            Please wait while we fetch the recipe details. This may take a moment.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
    );
  }
  
  if (error || !recipe) {
    return (
      <div className="max-w-4xl mx-auto py-8 px-4 text-center">
        <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Recipe Issue</h1>
        <p className="text-lg mb-6">
          {error || `The drink recipe you're looking for (ID: ${params.id}) could not be found.`}
        </p>
        <button 
          onClick={() => window.location.reload()}
          className="inline-block px-6 py-3 bg-yellow-600 text-white rounded hover:bg-yellow-700 mr-4"
        >
          Try Again
        </button>
        <a href="/menu" className="inline-block px-6 py-3 bg-blue-600 text-white rounded hover:bg-blue-700">
          Return to Menu
        </a>
      </div>
    );
  }

  return(
    <>
      <RecipeComponent
        id={recipe['id'] || params.id}
        title={recipe['title'] || 'Unnamed Recipe'}
        description={recipe['description'] || null}
        instructions={recipe['instructions'] || []}
        imageURL={recipe['imageURL'] || '/images/placeholder-drink.png'}
        ingredients={recipe['ingredients'] || []}
        type={'drinks'}
      />
    </>
  );
}
```

### Improvements to Address Long-Running API Calls:

1. **Request Timeout**: Added a 30-second timeout to prevent infinite loading if the API call hangs.

2. **Component Cleanup**: Added proper cleanup with the `isMounted` flag to prevent state updates if the component unmounts during the fetch.

3. **Better Loading State**: Added a more informative loading state with animation to indicate activity.

4. **Retry Button**: Added a "Try Again" button to allow users to retry the request without refreshing the page.

5. **Clear Error State**: Reset error state on each request to prevent old errors from persisting.

6. **Detailed Error Handling**: Improved error messages including specific handling for timeout errors.

If you're still having issues, you may want to check:

1. **API Response Format**: Ensure your `callRecipeApiWithID` is correctly parsing the API response.

2. **Network Monitoring**: Use browser DevTools Network tab to see if the API calls are actually completing successfully.

3. **API Consistency**: It's possible the API might be returning a successful HTTP status code but with an error in the response body.

Would you like me to suggest any additional debugging approaches or modify the solution further?

Assistant: 
I see the issue with your ChatbotComponent. The problem isn't as severe as the infinite API calls in the previous examples, but there's a styling issue that is likely causing your display problems. Let me fix it:

```typescript jsx
import {useEffect, useRef, useState} from "react";
import {getAIChat} from "@/app/lib/api";
import {ChatbotProps} from "@/app/interfaces";

export const ChatbotComponent = ({height = '60vh', context = ''}: ChatbotProps) => {
  const [messages, setMessages] = useState<Array<{ role: string; content: string }>>([
    { role: 'assistant', content: 'Hello! How can I help you today?' }
  ]);
  const [input, setInput] = useState('');
  const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);
  const messagesEndRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    messagesEndRef.current?.scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth' });
  }, [messages]);

  const handleSubmit = async (e: React.FormEvent) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    if (!input.trim()) return;

    const userMessage = { role: 'user', content: input };
    setMessages(prev => [...prev, userMessage]);
    setInput('');
    setIsLoading(true);

    try {
      console.log('Sending message:', input);
      let data = await getAIChat(input, context);
      console.log(
        'AI Chat Response:',
        data.text
      )

      setMessages(prev => [...prev, { role: 'assistant', content: data.text }]);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error sending message:', error);
      setMessages(prev => [...prev, {
        role: 'assistant',

          </button>
        </form>
      </div>
    </>
  )}
```

### The Main Issue:

The problem is in the way you're applying the height to your chat container. You're using template literals inside a className string:

```typescript jsx
<div className={`h-[${height}] overflow-y-auto mb-4 p-2`}>
```

This doesn't work correctly in Tailwind CSS with dynamic values. When you pass `height = '60vh'` as a prop, it tries to create a class like `h-[60vh]`, but Tailwind needs to generate this class at build time, not runtime.

### The Fix:

I've added an inline style to properly set the height:

```typescript jsx
<div className="overflow-y-auto mb-4 p-2" style={{ height }}>
```

This will correctly apply the height value (e.g., '60vh') as an inline style, which can handle dynamic values.

### Additional Recommendations:

1. If you're still experiencing issues with the API call, consider adding a debounce to your submit handler to prevent multiple rapid calls.

2. You might want to implement a retry mechanism for failed API calls, especially if they sometimes work after multiple attempts.

3. Consider adding a timeout for the API call, similar to what I suggested in the previous solution.

4. Add proper error handling for different types of errors (network errors, server errors, etc.)

Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
