This project is meant to be a simple food and cocktail recipe site. That uses AI but never has AI-generated recipes.

To get this site up and running. You must get a couple of API keys. A hyperbolic key (https://app.hyperbolic.xyz/), 
A pixabay API key (https://pixabay.com/) and create a SQL database either locally or on AWS with the SQL dump called DatabaseDump.
Then create a .env file filling it with the required fields as seen in .env.template.

After that you can run this application with npm install, then npm run.
