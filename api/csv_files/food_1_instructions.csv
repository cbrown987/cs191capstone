72," As a tragically jaded food professional, who's seen, and eaten it all, it's not often I'm shocked by a new type of food, but that's the perfect word to describe my experience the first time having chaat. We were trying a new Indian restaurant in San Francisco, and as I looked over the menu trying to find familiar favorites, the server mentioned that they had a special ""Chaat"" menu that evening. Oh, great. What's that again?
 He explained it was a type of Indian street food, and described a few offerings, but finished by admitting that to understand it, we really needed to try it. Unsure if this was just a clever sales pitch, or sincere advice, we took a shot and ordered a few of his recommendations. They arrived at our table a few minutes later, and a few minutes after that our minds were blown. Completely and utterly blown.
 One dish was ""Pani Puri,"" featuring small, round, crispy puffs that we filled with diced potatoes and pourable, herbaceous green chutney. It was beyond amazing, and I wanted 50 more. The other was ""Muri Makha;"" a salad of crispy, puffed rice, fruit, and vegetables, dressed with various chutneys. It was a masterpiece of tastes and textures, and one of more thrilling things I'd ever eaten. That experience inspired this ""potato chip salad."" I'm very proud of this, and hope you try it, but as I said in the video, I really hope it inspires you to go out and find the real stuff soon.

91," I've always gone out of my way to avoid egg salad, and had no plans to change that behavior this late in life, but after seeing people go nuts over this sandwich on social media, I decided to give it a go.
 Surprisingly, I didn't hate it. In fact, I kind of liked it, and have identified the two main reasons why. It comes served on soft, buttery, slightly sweet Japanese milk bread, which is the perfect delivery system. Plus, the salad is bound together with a super savory mayonnaise that, as my old buddy Guy Fieri might say, would taste great on a flip flop. The most popular brand of this mayo is called Kewpie, which is pretty easy to find. But just in case, I show a fairly close version using commonly found pantry ingredients.
 Mine doesn't include MSG, which is one reason people line up for the stuff, but it's still very savory. Between that and the homemade milk bread, I almost forgot I was eating egg salad. So, whether you love egg salad and have always wanted to try this, or you're not a huge fan (but willing to taste the world's most famous version), I hope you give this a try soon. Enjoy!

 Gather all ingredients.
 Place cabbage, apples, sugar, and butter into a large pot. Pour in vinegar and water, then add salt, pepper, and cloves. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat.
 Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until the cabbage is tender, 1 ¬Ω to 2 hours.
 Enjoy!
"
112," Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add onions, cook and stir until lightly browned. Sprinkle in the sugar, and continue cooking until onions are deep golden brown, about 10 minutes. Stir in the chicken broth and vinegar and season with paprika. Mix in the bread until dissolved. Bring to a boil, then simmer over low heat for 3 minutes.
 Transfer the mixture to a blender or food processor, and blend until smooth. Serve with pork or beef.
"
113," Place bread cubes into a large bowl. Heat milk until it starts to bubble at the edges, then pour it over bread cubes. Stir briefly to coat bread. Let soak for 15 minutes.
 Meanwhile, melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add onions; cook and stir until tender. Stir in parsley, and remove the skillet from the heat. Mix butter into the bowl with bread along with eggs, salt, and pepper. Using your hands, squeeze the dough through your fingers until it is smooth and sticky.
 Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. The water should be at least 3 or 4 inches deep. When the water is boiling, make a test dumpling about the size of a small orange or tangerine, by patting and cupping it between wet hands. Gently drop it into the boiling water. If it falls apart, the dough is too wet. In this case, stir some bread crumbs into the rest of the dumpling batter.
 Form the remaining dough into large dumplings, then carefully drop them into the boiling water. Simmer for 20 minutes, then remove to a serving plate with a large slotted spoon. They should come out soft, spongy, and delicious!
"
114," Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two baking sheets.
 Mix ground almonds, flour, white sugar, 2 teaspoons cocoa powder, cinnamon, cloves, baking powder, and salt together in a large bowl. Use your fingers or a pastry blender to rub in the butter until mixture resembles fine crumbs. Add honey and egg; mix together to form a dough.
 Dust work surface with flour. Roll out dough into a circle about 1/8-inch thick. Cut into gingerbread men shapes with a floured cookie cutter. Place 2 inches apart on baking sheets.
 Bake in the preheated oven until edges are brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool in the pan 1 to 2 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely, about 20 minutes.
 Combine confectioners' sugar and 2 tablespoons cocoa powder in a bowl. Mix in enough boiling water to make a smooth and spreadable icing. Spread icing on cooled cookies using a table knife. Set aside until icing hardens, about 2 hours.
 Substitute ground hazelnuts for the almonds if preferred.
 If you plan to hang the cookies, make a small hole at the top of their heads before baking.
"
115," Slice onion into quarters and separate layers. Add 8 cups water, potato, onion, butter, bay leaf, parsley, salt, and pepper into a large soup pot. Bring to a boil over medium heat; reduce heat to low and simmer until potatoes are tender, about 15 minutes.
 For the noodles: Mix flour, eggs, and about 1 teaspoon of salt in a separate bowl. Stir in enough water to form a thick dough. Slice into noodles; add to soup and cook until fluffy, abut 3 to 5 minutes.
 Add cream and heat through.
 I tilt the bowl over the soup and use a butter knife to cut strips as it pours.
 This soup tastes even better the next day.
"
116," Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 2 cookie sheets.
 Beat 1 cup sugar, butter, molasses, and egg together in a mixing bowl using an electric mixer.
 Sift flour, baking soda, ginger, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, cloves, salt, and nutmeg together in a bowl. Beat into butter mixture until combined.
 Combine 1/8 cup sugar and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon in a shallow bowl. Roll cookie dough into 1-inch balls. Roll cookies in the sugar-cinnamon mixture to coat. Place on the prepared cookie sheet.
 Bake in the preheated oven until golden and edges are set, about 11 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool at least 5 minutes before serving or storing.
 No need to press the dough once you place them on the cookie sheet, as they spread perfectly while baking.
 This is my first recipe posted on here, I do not have exactly how much it yields yet. The yield listed is approximate.
"
117," Bring 4 quarts of water to a boil. Add 1 tablespoon salt. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes.
 Combine vinegar, sugar, dill, and parsley in a large bowl. Muddle the herbs with flat spatula and mix until sugar is dissolved. Whisk in mayonnaise, lime juice, and 1 teaspoon salt until creamy. Stir in celery and onion. Cover and refrigerate.
 Rinse pasta under cold water. Fold pasta into the dressing until evenly coated. Cover and refrigerate, folding salad occasionally so that dressing is evenly absorbed, 8 hours to overnight. Add more mayonnaise if pasta looks dry.
 Gently fold in shrimp in the last fold before serving.
 Bow ties or small shells also work. If using bow ties, mayonnaise may have to be increased by 1/4 to 1/2 cup.
 Short on time? Still tastes great after chilling for only a couple hours. Mix the dressing first, while the pasta water comes to a boil, and refrigerate. Chop the onions and celery while the pasta is cooking, and add to the dressing in the fridge. When pasta is cooked, drained and, cooled, add to the dressing. Chill until serving time.
